## Data 
I used images I found on google of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk.
## Facial recognnitionn and the Thatcher Effect
Explorations in facial recognitions models on images that induce the thatcher effect. Thatcher effect was tested on 4 pretrained facial embedding models: FaceNet, Resnet50, VGG16, SeNet50. The validation folder was run with each of the models. The images were only tested in the facial embeddings phase and did not run through the classification phase.

## Facial Recognition and the Inverse Effect
Explorations in facial recognitions models on images that induce the inverse effect. The test folder was run with the VGG16 model and then a SVM classifier was used to classify the images.
